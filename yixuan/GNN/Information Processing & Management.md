- **Language:** Manuscripts must be written in English (American or British usage is accepted). Authors who believe their English language manuscript requires editing may wish to use the [English Language Editing Service](https://webshop.elsevier.com/language-editing-services/language-editing/).
- **Page Limit:** There is no set upper page limit, but please consider the comfort of your readers. Submitted manuscripts are typically 30 or so pages doubled spaced at 11 pt. font, plus reference pages. There generally are at least 30 to 40 references, often more. Consider this a guideline.
- **Prior Publication Policy:** IP&M publishes only original research papers that have not been previously published. However, IP&M encourages authors of articles published in English at conferences to submit enhanced versions for publication in IP&M. IP&M acknowledges that there may be benefits for the publishing of research previously published in a non-English outlet, so enhanced versions of these many be submitted. IP&M, in general, will **not** accept the submission of an identical or nearly identical manuscript posted on a publically accessible archiving site (e.g., arXiv.org, etc.).
- **Simultaneous submissions:** Simultaneous submissions are not allowed. Your work must not, wholly or in part, be under consideration at other venues (conference, journals, book chapters, etc.) at the time of submission to IP&M.
- **Statistics Format:** When reporting statistics, authors must provide sufficient information such that the reader can validate the analysis. Authors are referred to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Sixth Edition.
- **References Format:** Although not required for initial submissions to IP&M, citations in accepted articles should follow the referencing style used by the American Psychological Association. Authors are referred to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Sixth Edition. Whatever reference style used in the initial submission, ensure references are complete, and style is consistent.
- **Survey/Review Articles:** Survey manuscripts must address a broad topic in the field, be the result of a rigorous research identification methodology (either scoping or systematic), outline the state of the field, be able to differentiate from other similar review articles already published, and provide recommendations for future research. Typically, survey manuscripts cover a new or novel topic in the field.

**Suggestions for Your Submission**

Here are some suggestions to facilitate your submissions clearing desk review.

- **Title:** The title should clearly express what the research in the manuscript is about.
- **Abstract:** The abstract should highlight the specifics of the research or findings (i.e., provide some numbers, metrics, specifics, etc.).
- **Literature Review:** Ensure you are citing the most current and relevant research in the field. The literature review also needs to tie your research to the information science community. The literature review should not just list related papers but should make clear how and why your results build on prior work. IP&M welcomes interdisciplinary papers that draw links to other literature, but submissions that are unable to cite relevant information science research might not be within the scope of IP&M
- **Research Questions/Objectives:** There needs to be an explicit research question(s) / objective(s) stated, preferably as a separate section.
- **Dataset(s) and Methods:** If you employ dataset(s), provide justification on why the dataset(s) is appropriate. For methods and analysis, provide justification for usage. If claiming an advancement of an algorithmic process, include a legitimate baseline for comparison employing a Gold Standard test set, if available.
- **Implications:** The manuscript should contain an explicit discussion section clearly highlighting the theoretical and/or practical implications of the research.
- **References:** Do not cite 'preprints', 'working papers', 'tech reports', etc. if actual peer-reviewed articles are available.

**Your Paper Your Way**

The only formatting requirement for your initial manuscript to IP&M is that it be single columned to facilitate the review. Only if your manuscript is at the revision stage, will you be requested to put your manuscript into a specified format and provide the items required for the publication of your manuscript. However, we encourage authors to examine published IP&M articles to facilitate the conversion that will be necessary if accepted.<br />If you wish, IP&M has templates in both Word and LaTeX formats, to aid with submissions. The templates can be found at: [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-processing-and-management/policies/author-templates](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-processing-and-management/policies/author-templates)<br />You can also see the [Guide to Publishing with Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/submit-your-paper).<br />**Submission Checklist**

You can use this list to carry out a final check of your submission before submitting to IP&M.<br />A submission to IP&M entails the following items:

- **Cover Letter:** If your submission is based on prior published research, the cover letter is the reasonable medium to fully disclose the previous publication(s) of the manuscript or any portion of the manuscript and the level of copyright.
- **Recommended Reviewers:** Authors are required to recommend at least 5 international reviewers from a mixture of countries and institutions. These recommended reviewers must be published in the research area, with no conflicts. Authors must provide institutions, institution email addresses, and reasons for recommending. Note: There is a possibility that IP&M may have to reject your manuscript if we are unable to find enough reviewers after a reasonable period.
- **Title Page:** With the title, author names, and affiliations. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the postal address of each affiliation, including the country name, and the e-mail address of each author. Indicate who is the corresponding author.
- **Highlights:** Highlights consist of a short collection of bullet points that capture the novel results of your research. Please have a look at the examples here: [example Highlights](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/highlights). Highlights should include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 characters, including spaces, per bullet point).
- **Manuscript:** The manuscript must include a maximum of 6 keywords, all figures (including relevant captions), all tables (including titles, description, footnotes). Authors are required to obtain a copyright for material within their submission. Ensure the manuscript has been spell-checked and grammar-checked. Ensure all references mentioned in the reference list are cited in the text, and vice versa.
- **Competing Interests Statement:** A competing interests statement is provided, even if the authors have no competing interests to declare.
- **Author contributions:** For transparency, authors are to submit an author statement file outlining their contributions to the paper using the relevant CRediT roles: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Funding acquisition; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Resources; Software; Supervision; Validation; Visualization; Roles/Writing - original draft; Writing - review & editing. Authorship statements should be formatted with the names of authors first and CRediT role(s) following. [More details and an example.](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics/credit-author-statement)

**Optional Submission Items**

- **Supplementary material (optional):** Supplementary material can be published with your article to enhance it. Submitted supplementary items are published exactly as they are received (Excel or PowerPoint files will appear as such online). Please submit your material together with the article and supply a concise, descriptive caption for each supplementary file. If you wish to make changes to supplementary material during any stage of the process, please make sure to provide an updated file. Do not annotate any corrections on a previous version. Please accept all 'Track Changes' in Microsoft Office files as these will appear in the published version.
- **Data visualization (optional):** Include interactive data visualizations in your publication and let your readers interact and engage more closely with your research. Follow the instructions to find out about available data visualization options and how to include them with your article.
- **Research data (optional):** IP&M encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, IP&M also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods, and other useful materials related to the project.

**Submission declaration and verification**

Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract, a published lecture or academic thesis, see '[Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics)' for more information), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyright- holder. To verify originality, your article may be checked by the originality detection service [Crossref Similarity Check](https://www.elsevier.com/editors/perk/plagiarism-complaints/plagiarism-detection).<br />**Ethics in Publishing**

Please see our information pages on [Ethics in publishing](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/publishing-ethics) and [Ethical guidelines for journal publication.](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics)<br />**Use of Inclusive Language**

Inclusive language acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities. Articles should make no assumptions about the beliefs or commitments of any reader, should contain nothing which might imply that one individual is superior to another on the grounds of race, sex, culture, or any other characteristic, and should use inclusive language throughout. Authors should ensure that writing is free from bias, for instance by using 'he or she', 'his/her' instead of 'he' or 'his', and by making use of job titles that are free of stereotyping (e.g. 'chairperson' instead of 'chairman' and 'flight attendant' instead of 'stewardess').<br />**Changes to Authorship**

Authors are expected to consider the list and order of authors carefully **before** submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any addition, deletion, or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only **before** the manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal Editor. To request such a change, the Editor must receive the following from the **corresponding author**: (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation (e-mail, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the author being added or removed.<br />**Article Transfer Service**

IP&M is part of our Article Transfer Service. This means that if the Editor feels your article is more suitable in one of our other participating journals, then you may be asked to consider transferring the article to one of those. If you agree, your article will be transferred automatically on your behalf with no need to reformat. Please note that your article will be reviewed again by the new journal. [More information](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/submit-your-paper/submit-and-revise/article-transfer-service).<br />**After Acceptance ? Copyright**

Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' (see [more information](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright)on this). An e-mail will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript together with a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' form or a link to the online version of this agreement.<br />Subscribers may reproduce tables of contents or prepare lists of articles including abstracts for internal circulation within their institutions. [Permission](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright/permissions) of the Publisher is required for resale or distribution outside the institution and for all other derivative works, including compilations and translations. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article. Elsevier has preprinted forms for use by authors in these cases. For gold open access articles: Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete an 'Exclusive License Agreement' ([more information](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright)). Permitted third party reuse of gold open access articles is determined by the author's choice of [user license](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/open-access-licenses).<br />**After Acceptance ? Author Rights**

As an author, you (or your employer or institution) have certain rights to reuse your work. [More information](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright).

Please visit our [Open Access page](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/information-processing-and-management/0306-4573/open-access-options) for more information.<br />**After Acceptance ? Online Proof Correction**

To ensure a fast publication process of the article, we ask authors to provide us with their proof corrections within two days. Corresponding authors will receive an e-mail with a link to our online proofing system, allowing annotation and correction of proofs online. The environment is similar to MS Word: in addition to editing text, you can also comment on figures/tables and answer questions from the Copy Editor. Web-based proofing provides a faster and less error-prone process by allowing you to directly type your corrections, eliminating the potential introduction of errors.<br />If preferred, you can still choose to annotate and upload your edits on the PDF version. All instructions for proofing will be given in the e-mail we send to authors, including alternative methods to the online version and PDF.<br />We will do everything possible to get your article published quickly and accurately. Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness, and correctness of the text, tables, and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one communication. Please check carefully before replying, as the inclusion of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.<br />**After Acceptance Off Prints**

The corresponding author will, at no cost, receive a customized [Share Link](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/submit-your-paper/sharing-and-promoting-your-article/share-link) providing 50 days free access to the final published version of the article on [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/). The Share Link can be used for sharing the article via any communication channel, including email and social media. For an extra charge, paper offprints can be ordered via the offprint order form, which is sent once the article is accepted for publication. Both corresponding and co-authors may order offprints at any time via Elsevier's [Author Services](https://webshop.elsevier.com/article-services/article-offprints/). Corresponding authors who have published their article gold open access do not receive a Share Link as their final published version of the article is available open access on ScienceDirect and can be shared through the article DOI link.<br />**Author Inquiries**
